Entity
	position denote center of rectangular sprite
	also center of bounding box
	sprite.setOrigin() in animation class constructor

Player
	animations: stand, run, air
	determine and assign animation
	controls: A D W Space
	can move in air
	can only jump when standing on a tile
	hold jump vs release (start falling)
	shoot in direction facing
	collide with Tile entities
	does not collide with Dec entities
	gravity component - accelerate downward
	maximum speed (either direction)
	CBoundingBox specified in level file

Animations
	assets file
	store multiple frames inside a texture
	Animation class handles frame advancement based on animation speed
	implement Animation::update()
	implement Animation::hasEnded()
	can be repeated or non-repeating
	non-repeating: destroyed once hasEnded() returns true

Decoration Entities
	Drawn on screen, no other interaction
	
Tiles
	Level geometry, interact with players
	Any animation
	CBoundingBox size of animationtile->getComponent<CAnimation>().animation.getSize()
	current animation for a tile retrieved with tile->getComponent<CAnimation>().animation.getName()
	Tiles have different behaviour depending on which Animation they are given

Brick Tiles
	Brick animation
	collide with bullet or hit from below: destroyed
		animation change to Explosion
		bounding box removed

Question Tiles
	Question animation
	hit from below: Question2 animation, lifespan entity Coin animation appear for 30 frames, 64 pixels above

Bonus
	special effects
	special weapon
	NPCs

Misc
	P pause
	T toggle drawing textures
	C draw bounding box
	G draw grid
